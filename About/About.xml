	This mod adds a linkable building that houses an AI.  On its own, it will enhance workspeed by a little, but to really get the full benefit, you need to start cranking up its power.  
	
	Workspeed bonus increases linearly, while power needs increase exponentially.  
	
	This came about through my need for everything to happen faster and my observation that there isn't that much use for ridiculously overbuilt power systems.
